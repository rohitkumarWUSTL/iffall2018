	<h1>Postcard Feedback</h1>
	<h2>For: Lily Greenwald</h2>

	<p>I like the quote placement in terms of composition, but for both "Bears. Beats. Battle Star Galactica." images, the text's readability suffers slightly and would benefit from more contrast with the background. Possible solutions could include different placement, text color, or a solid color background for the quote. It's also worth checking to make sure that the other quotes will contrast sufficiently with the characters' faces to ensure the readibility isn't affected by text's background changing when the picture gets resized.</p>

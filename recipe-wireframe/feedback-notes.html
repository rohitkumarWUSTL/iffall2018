We agreed that splitting the screen horizontally would be an unwise decision for a mobile website given the limited real estate provided by the screen.

I also originally presented the recipe as two separate processes that were combined at the end, but received the helpful feedback that this could be misconstrued as two separate recipes - I'll need to communicate more effectively that this is a single recipe consisting of two components.
